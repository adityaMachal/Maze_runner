# Maze Solver — Animated Pathfinding Visualizer

A Python maze solver showcasing DFS, BFS, A*, and Dijkstra pathfinding algorithms with real-time Matplotlib animations.

## Features
- Random maze generation using a recursive backtracker or a fixed test maze
- Implementations of DFS, BFS, A*, and Dijkstra
- Animated visualization of the search process using Matplotlib
- CLI to select algorithm, maze size, and animation speed
- Reconstructs and highlights the final solution path

## Quick demo
Replace these placeholders with screenshots or GIFs from your runs:       
 — DFS animation(Demo)
 - <img width="400" height="450" alt="Figure_1" src="images/DFS.png" />
 — BFS animation(Demo)
 - <img width="400" height="450" alt="Figure_2" src="images/BFS.png" />

To create GIFs from Matplotlib animations, save frames and stitch them with `ffmpeg` (optional).

## Requirements
Tested on Python 3.13.
